## `` A simple Algorithm to determine how many pairs of number can add upto the target number``
=============================================================

>*But the program panicks when the iteration exceeds 10.*.

>Crate used **num = 0.4.0**.

The error handling is poor, please update it.

>The algo just substruct the target number and check if the remainder is in the list. But there are no duplications.
